Hey! Thanks for stopping by!

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
I'm available for hire! You can find my CV [here](/cv.pdf).
{{< /alert >}}

My name is John Patrick but my friends call me JP. I was born and raised in Oslo, Norway. 

In 2020, I moved to the United Kingdom to study Computer Science at De Montfort University in Leicester. I went straight from high school to employment in the cyber security industry, but I found out that it wasn't for me and I realized that I wanted pursue a career in software engineering instead.

I do a lot of things. I love cooking, [programming](https://github.com/GOATS2K), [making music and DJing](https://soundcloud.com/closurednb). I used to have a radio show from 2016 to 2020 on the internet station [rekt.network](https://rekt.network), where I played 2 hour long drum & bass sets every Sunday.

My first programming language was Python, which I still write today, albeit a lot less than I used to. My new primary programming language is C#, a language I picked up during my employment at [SuperOffice](https://superoffice.com), where my job was to revamp and modernize an old resource management system using ASP.NET Core and Angular. By old, I mean .NET Framework 1.0 kinda old.

Why don't you check out some of the things I've made [here](/projects)?

## I am available for hire!

I'm looking for work starting in June 2023. 
I'm open to pretty much anything related to software engineering - backend development is where I am the most skilled, although my frontend skills are steadily improving.
I have some leadership experience and enjoy mentoring others, but solving complex software problems is where I thrive.

I will be relocating to London, UK with my partner, so I would love to work in the area. 

My contact details are in my CV linked above.
