Hey! Thanks for stopping by!

My name is John Patrick but my friends call me JP. I was born and raised in Oslo, Norway. In 2020, I moved to the United Kingdom to study Computer Science at De Montfort University in Leicester. I went straight from high school to employment in the cyber security industry, but I found out that it wasn't for me and I realized that I wanted pursue a career in software engineering instead.

I do a lot of things. I love cooking, [programming](https://github.com/GOATS2K), [making music and DJing](https://soundcloud.com/closurednb). I used to have a radio show from 2016 to 2020 on the internet station [rekt.network](https://rekt.network), where I played 2 hour long drum & bass sets every Sunday.

My first programming language was Python, which I still write today, albeit a lot less than I used to. My new primary programming language is C#, a language I picked up during my employment at [SuperOffice](https://superoffice.com), where my job was to revamp and modernize an old resource management system using ASP.NET Core and Angular. By old, I mean .NET Framework 1.0 kinda old.

Why don't you check out some of the things I've made [here](/projects)?
